## Overview

This Python library allows you to easily fetch data about football matches from the FlashScore website (flashscore.com). It is designed for asynchronous operation, providing fast and efficient data retrieval. In some parts of the library, the `grequests` library is used to enhance performance.

## Features

- Asynchronous Data Retrieval: The library employs Python's asynchronous approach using the `asyncio` framework to make asynchronous HTTP requests, allowing for efficient data retrieval from FlashScore.

- Historical Match Data: Access to historical data about past football matches, including match results, team statistics, and top scorers.

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/progeroffline/fs-football-lib
cd fs-football-lib
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of using the library to fetch historical match data:

```python
from flashscore import FlashscoreApi

api = FlashscoreApi()
countries = api.get_countries()

for country in countries:
    leagues = country.get_leagues()

    for league in leagues:
        season = league.get_season()

        current_season = season[0]
        for match in current_season.get_matches():
            print(match)
            match.load_content()
            print(match)
```

Here is a simple example of using the library to fetch data about today's matches:

```python
from flashscore import FlashscoreApi

api = FlashscoreApi()
today_matches = api.get_today_matches()

for i, match in enumerate(today_matches):
    match.load_content()
```
